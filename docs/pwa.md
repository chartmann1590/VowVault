## PWA Requirements
- **HTTPS Required** - PWA features only work with valid SSL certificates
- **Self-signed certificates** will not work for PWA installation
- **Production deployment** should use proper SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt, etc.)

## Troubleshooting PWA Issues

### Development/Testing:
- Use Chrome DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Manifest â†’ "Add to home screen"
- Check browser console for PWA debug messages
- Visit `/admin/pwa-debug?key=your-key` for detailed analysis

### Production Setup:
- Ensure valid SSL certificate is installed
- Verify manifest.json is accessible at `/static/manifest.json`
- Check service worker registration in browser console
- Test on multiple devices and browsers

## PWA Debug Tools
The admin panel includes comprehensive PWA debugging tools:
- **Requirements Check** - Verify HTTPS, manifest, service worker, and icons
- **Connection Analysis** - View host, URL, and user agent details
- **Troubleshooting Guide** - Solutions for common PWA issues
- **Quick Actions** - Direct links to manifest and service worker files

## Technical Implementation

### Manifest File
The `manifest.json` file defines the PWA properties:
- App name and description
- Theme colors and background
- Icon definitions for different sizes
- Display mode and orientation
- App shortcuts for quick access

### Service Worker
The `sw.js` service worker provides:
- Offline caching of essential resources
- Background sync capabilities
- Cache management and updates
- Network request interception

**Service Worker Route**: The service worker is served at `/sw.js` with proper JavaScript MIME type for optimal browser compatibility.

### Icons
Multiple icon sizes are provided for different devices:
- 16x16, 32x32, 72x72, 96x96, 128x128
- 144x144, 152x152, 192x192, 384x384, 512x512
- Maskable icons for adaptive design

## Security Considerations

2. Verify HTTPS setup
3. Check installation prompts
4. Test offline functionality

## Common Issues

### Service Worker 404 Error
If you see `GET /sw.js HTTP/1.1" 404` in logs:
- âœ… **Fixed**: Service worker is now properly served at `/sw.js` via the main blueprint
- The route was added to `app/views/main.py` to handle service worker requests
- Uses correct static folder path (`../static`) for modular structure
- Check browser console for successful registration
- Verify HTTPS setup for production use
