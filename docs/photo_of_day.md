## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

```bash
# If migration fails, check database permissions
chmod 755 instance/
chmod 644 instance/wedding_photos.db
```

#### Voting Issues
- **"User identifier required"**: Ensure cookies are enabled
- **"Already voted"**: Users can only vote once per contest
- **"No contest found"**: Admin needs to create a contest for today
- **"Voting closed"**: Contest voting period has ended

#### Admin Access Issues
- **"Unauthorized"**: Check admin key in URL parameter
- **"Photo not found"**: Ensure photo exists in database
- **"Contest already exists"**: Only one contest per date allowed

#### Contest Management Issues
- **"No candidates found"**: Add photos as candidates first
- **"Winner already selected"**: Only one winner per contest
- **"Invalid candidate"**: Ensure candidate belongs to the contest

### Debug Steps
1. **Check Database**: Verify tables exist with `sqlite3 instance/wedding_photos.db`
2. **Check Settings**: Verify threshold setting: `SELECT * FROM settings WHERE key='photo_of_day_likes_threshold'`
3. **Check Logs**: Review application logs for errors
4. **Test Migration**: Run `python migration.py` to ensure all tables exist
5. **Verify Routes**: Check that blueprints are registered correctly
