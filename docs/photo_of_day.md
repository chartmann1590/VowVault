## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Migration Errors
```bash
# If migration fails, check database permissions
chmod 755 instance/
chmod 644 instance/wedding_photos.db
```

#### Voting Issues
- **"User identifier required"**: Ensure cookies are enabled
- **"Already voted"**: Users can only vote once per day
- **"No photo of the day"**: Admin needs to select a photo for today

#### Admin Access Issues
- **"Unauthorized"**: Check admin key in URL parameter
- **"Photo not found"**: Ensure photo exists in database
- **"Date already exists"**: Only one photo per date allowed

#### Auto-Candidate Issues
- **"No auto-candidates found"**: Increase likes threshold or add more likes to photos
- **"Threshold validation error"**: Ensure threshold is between 1-50
- **"Duplicate candidates"**: System prevents adding same photo twice

### Debug Steps
1. **Check Database**: Verify tables exist with `sqlite3 instance/wedding_photos.db`
2. **Check Settings**: Verify threshold setting: `SELECT * FROM settings WHERE key='photo_of_day_likes_threshold'`
3. **Check Logs**: Review application logs for errors
4. **Test Migration**: Run `python migration.py` to ensure all tables exist
5. **Verify Routes**: Check that blueprints are registered correctly
