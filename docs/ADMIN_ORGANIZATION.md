# Admin Panel Organization

The admin panel has been reorganized to provide a cleaner, more organized experience with separate pages for different functionality.

## New Admin Dashboard

The main admin page (`/admin`) now serves as a dashboard with:

- **Quick Statistics**: Overview of photos, likes, comments, guestbook entries, messages, and photobooth photos
- **Quick Actions**: Download all content, system reset, PWA debug
- **Organized Navigation**: Cards for different admin sections

## Admin Sections

### Content Management
- **Photos & Videos** (`/admin/photos`): Manage uploaded photos and videos with filtering and search
- **Guestbook** (`/admin/guestbook`): Manage guestbook entries
- **Message Board** (`/admin/messages`): Manage message board posts
- **Photo of the Day** (`/admin/photo-of-day`): Set featured photos

### Settings & Configuration
- **Photobooth Settings** (`/admin/photobooth`): Configure virtual photobooth
- **QR Code Settings** (`/admin/qr-settings`): Generate QR codes for sharing
- **Welcome Modal** (`/admin/welcome-settings`): Configure welcome message
- **Security Settings** (`/admin/security`): SSO and CAPTCHA configuration

### Integrations & Services
- **Email Settings** (`/admin/email-settings`): Configure email photo upload with logs
- **Immich Sync** (`/admin/immich-settings`): Sync photos to Immich server with logs
- **Push Notifications** (`/admin/notifications`): Manage notification users

### System & Maintenance

- **Database Maintenance** (`/admin/database`): Optimize and maintain database

## Key Improvements

## Migration Notes

The old admin page (`admin.html`) has been replaced with:
- `admin_dashboard.html` - Main dashboard

- `admin_immich_settings.html` - Immich settings with logs

All existing functionality is preserved, just better organized.
